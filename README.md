# Vagrant::Tools

With many vagrant instances running wild, this gem provides VM management via cli.

*NOTE: This gem is still under construction, base skeleton is inplace but it's not yet functional.*


## Roadmap

* Version (0.0.1)

  * Initial project
  * List all vagrant configurations
  * Mark active or inactive (Virtualbox)
  * Add basic controls for up/ halt/ destroy etc.
